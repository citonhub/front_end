              <h5>Riiid AIEd Challenge 2020</h5>
              <p >
                  Think back to your favorite teacher. They motivated and inspired you to learn. And they knew your strengths and weaknesses. The lessons they taught were based on your ability. For example, teachers would make sure you understood algebra before advancing to calculus. Yet, many students don’t have access to personalized learning. In a world full of information, data scientists like you can help. Machine learning can offer a path to success for young people around the world, and you are invited to be part of this mission.

In 2018, 260 million children weren't attending school.

                   At the same time, more than half of these young students didn't meet minimum reading and math standards. Education was already in a tough place when COVID-19 forced most countries to temporarily close schools. This further delayed learning opportunities and intellectual development. The equity gaps in every country could grow wider. We need to re-think the current education system in terms of attendance, engagement, and individualized attention.

Riiid Labs, an AI solutions provider delivering creative disruption to the education market, empowers global education players to rethink traditional ways of learning leveraging AI. With a strong belief in equal opportunity in education, Riiid launched an AI tutor based on deep-learning algorithms in 2017 that attracted more than one million South Korean students. This year, the company released EdNet, the world’s largest open database for AI education containing more than 100 million student interactions.

            In this competition, your challenge is to create algorithms for "Knowledge Tracing," the modeling of student knowledge over time. The goal is to accurately predict how students will perform on future interactions. You will pair your machine learning skills using Riiid’s EdNet data.

Your innovative algorithms will help tackle global challenges in education. If successful, it’s possible that any student with an Internet connection can enjoy the benefits of a personalized learning experience, regardless of where they live. With your participation, we can build a better and more equitable model for education in a post-COVID-19 world.
